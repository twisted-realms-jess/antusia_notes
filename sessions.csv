Session,Notes
1,"We met in a Tavern called the Road House in Bruron to talk to Nom, a human man."
1,"All of us owed H&M Couriers a favour, which has now been called in."
1,"The mission was to surveil a hand-off involving Emilda Vasua in the market."
1,"We scouted out the market and positioned ourselves to watch the hand-off."
1,"Madori stood right next to Emilda as she placed the item in a bag."
1,"Madori took the bag and the group fled the market."
1,"Zala saw signs of a staged ambush in which Emilda was apparently killed."
1,"As we fled the scene, we heard an explosion from the other side of town."
1,"Back at the Road House, we were accosted by a group of masked individuals, two of whom fled the scene."
1,"We interrogated one of the individuals, Barry, but he didn’t know anything."
1,"We investigated Nom’s room at the top of the tavern and found magical items including books and a giant hollow scaly egg, which they took as they left the area."
1,"Enid brought the group to her brother’s house and her familiar reported on the explosion at the Burn branch of H&M Couriers."
1,"Emilda’s item was a key and the false egg contained a box."
1,"The key is persistent about opening the box  and burns through two doors."
1,"As the key opens the box, a flash of white light burst out and knocked us out."
1,"As we woke up, each of us now wore a new piece of jewellery on one hand and a new, incomplete tattoo."
2,"We realised the box contained 5 pieces of jewellery but we only had 4."
2,"Looked like the 5th piece of jewellery escaped through a smashed window."
2,"Bertrand told Enid her father is looking for her."
2,"Brett sent a letter to the Hall of the Righteous to explain what happend at the tavern."
