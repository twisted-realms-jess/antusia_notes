Session,Notes
Session 1,"We met in a Tavern called the Road House in Bruron to talk to Nom, a human man."
Session 1,"All of us owed H&M Couriers a favour, which has now been called in."
Session 1,"The mission was to surveil a hand-off involving Emilda Vasua in the market."
Session 1,"We scouted out the market and positioned ourselves to watch the hand-off."
Session 1,"Madori stood right next to Emilda as she placed the item in a bag."
Session 1,"Madori took the bag and the group fled the market."
Session 1,"Zala saw signs of a staged ambush in which Emilda was apparently killed."
Session 1,"As we fled the scene, we heard an explosion from the other side of town."
Session 1,"Back at the Road House, we were accosted by a group of masked individuals, two of whom fled the scene."
Session 1,"We interrogated one of the individuals, Barry, but he didn’t know anything."
Session 1,"We investigated Nom’s room at the top of the tavern and found magical items including books and a giant hollow scaly egg, which they took as they left the area."
Session 1,"Enid brought the group to her brother’s house and her familiar reported on the explosion at the Burn branch of H&M Couriers."
Session 1,"Emilda’s item was a key and the false egg contained a box."
Session 1,"The key is persistent about opening the box  and burns through two doors."
Session 1,"As the key opens the box, a flash of white light burst out and knocked us out."
Session 1,"As we woke up, each of us now wore a new piece of jewellery on one hand and a new, incomplete tattoo."
Session 2,"We realised the box contained 5 pieces of jewellery but we only had 4."
Session 2,"Looked like the 5th piece of jewellery escaped through a smashed window."
Session 2,"Bertrand told Enid her father is looking for her."
Session 2,"Brett sent a letter to the Hall of the Righteous to explain what happend at the tavern."
Session 2,"We walked past the explosion site and hide the jewellery box in there. We find books on magical crystals causing explosions."
Session 2,"Adrik examines the jewellery and finds it's made of dragonsteel, a metal only made possible with the power of dragon's breath."
Session 2,"We visit Professor Carmen at the unviversity, who told us our jewellery was related to Old Magic."
Session 2,"Carmen suggests we try filling our jewellery with power to see how they react."
Session 2,"We go to see Archmage Silence at the Spire and he tells us our jewellery are called fabrials."
Session 2,"Silence tells us about fabrials. Fabrials originate from long ago when everyone in the world was capable of wielding Old Magic. They were created and given to the people charged with keeping the world safe and thus made them more powerful than the average person, these people were called The Heralds. They were inactive having been drained of all power but can be charged and empowered by taking in Old Magic. They can maintain their own power levels to an extent but cannot spontaneously generate Old Magic. Sources of Old Magic are incredibly rare mostly found in artefacts or very powerful items alongside rare locations of great magical workings and in the hearts of mythical beasts."
Session 2,"Silence also tells us about the Heralds, a group who use fabrials to usher in a peaceful time."
Session 2,"Silence allowed us to power our fabrials using one of his items. This gives us two new feats. We can store up to 10 items in our fabrial and retrieve them with a free action. Once per long rest, we can detect Old Magic within 60ft."
Session 3,"We went to see Tauvea Dawnfighter at the Pimp My Hide tattoo shop."
Session 3,"Thauvea initially thought Enid was visiting on behalf of her brother to apologise for something."
Session 3,"Thauvea believes our tattoos could function as containment for a powerful enchantment."
Session3,"Thauvea also said she saw similar motifs in a book in the library of FUlkhost Richardson."
Session 3,"Madori knows of the Richardson name as they are the most prominent family in Volheim."
Session 3,"Lady Richardson is held in high regard, but her children are widely hated as they behave like spoilt rich kids."
Session 3,"We went to Fulkhost Richardson's manor but it was deserted, so we snuck in."
Session 3,"We found the book Thauvea mentioned, which discussed The Heralds."
Session 3,"Adrik found a secret basement, which had an Old Magic contraption for draining magic crystals and creating an explosive magic liquidan organization of empowered magic guardians from ages past who were the original owners of the Fabrials. This was the cause of the H&M Couriers explosion."
Session 3,"Enid drained the object and absorbed its power. She gained a powerful monkey familiar called Chrysis."
Session 3,"We found a letter from Fulkhost to the Couriers of Fate saying he would like to help them but his mother still controlled the estates. However, the Empyrean would continue to be at the Courier's disposal."
Session 3,"We also found a map with four marked locations: H&M Couriers, The Spire, The Gatehouse and The Proving."
Session 3,"The last thing we found was a list of names, which contained Enid and her family's names."
Session 3,"We went back to Enid's house and heard Brett and Taryn discussing plans for vengeance on the people who killed Emilda."
Session 3,"Taryn decided we should ambush anyone who might come to attck us that evening, and then they would help smuggle us out of town the next day."
Session 3,"Taryn believes some members of the military may have been involved in the attacks of the previous days."
Session 3,"We were attacked during the night and Brett and Taryn helped with the fight."
Session 3,"One of the attackers activated a bomb, but Enid and Taryn we able to defuse it."
Session 4,"Brett and Taryn helped to smuggle us out of town and onto the airship The Phantom to Volheim."
Session 4,"
